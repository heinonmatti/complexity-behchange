**Welcome!**

This site is a companion web page to a manuscript about studying behaviour change mechanisms in complex systems. See top bar for navigation.

* GitHub repository for the files can be found [here](https://github.com/heinonmatti/complexity-behchange).  
* The manuscript can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/11/5/77) and an earlier preprint version [here](https://psyarxiv.com/fxgw4).
* Preprint source code can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heinonmatti/complexity-behchange/master/_complexity-manuscript.Rmd).

Additional learning materials:

* A list of video lectures explaining the relevant techniques and concepts can be found [here](https://mattiheino.com/complexity-channel).
* A more generic course on dynamic systems and chaos can be found on [Complexity Explorer](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses), with videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF0b3ThojznQwpDEClMZmHssMsuPnQxZT).
* An excellent introductory course to fractals and scaling can be found [here](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/102-fractals-and-scaling).
